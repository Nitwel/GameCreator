# GameCreator

This is a shool project I did in 10th grade.
The project is build upon gloop which allows to create visual 3d shapes in Java.

I've created this project for a few computer sience lessons to introduce my classmates into how to develop games etc.
Docs and some Tasks are included in the project if you want to give it a try. The tasks are only in German so maybe try Google translate if you dont know german. [Docs](https://github.com/Nitwel/GameCreator/blob/master/GameCreator%20Dokumentation.pdf)  |   [Tasks](https://github.com/Nitwel/GameCreator/blob/master/Tasks.pdf)

Have fun messing arround with this project.
